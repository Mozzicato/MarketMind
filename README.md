# MarketMind
An AI-powered autonomous business agent built on Celo that enables informal market vendors to accept stablecoin payments, track revenue, manage inventory, and build onchain credit reputation.  The agent operates as a financial brain for micro-businesses — holding its own ERC-8004 wallet, receiving payments and autonomously optimizing capital.
